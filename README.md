## **Introduction**
The Coffee Shop Inventory Management System helps coffee shop owners manage their inventory, track sales, and generate analytics reports. This project simplifies daily tasks and improves efficiency in small coffee shops by providing a simple and user-friendly interface.

---

## **The Story**
This project was inspired by the growing need for small businesses, especially coffee shops, to better organize their operations. The idea was conceived after realizing how crucial inventory management is for these shops. The system started as a basic order and inventory tracker but evolved into a more robust solution, with user authentication, reporting features, and sales analytics.
